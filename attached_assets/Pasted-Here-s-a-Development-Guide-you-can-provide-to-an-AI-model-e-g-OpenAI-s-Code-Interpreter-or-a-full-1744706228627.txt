Here‚Äôs a Development Guide you can provide to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI‚Äôs Code Interpreter or a full-stack code generation model) to build the Visitor Experience (VX) Academy Platform. The guide breaks down the platform requirements based on the document into structured components suitable for an AI coding assistant.
